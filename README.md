# NoSelfHelmet
A simple Minecraft 1.8.9 Forge mod that can disable the player's helmet from rendering.<br>
I prefer the look of most player skins without a helmet on, so after I started to use the [Ears mod](https://ears.unascribed.com/),
I created this to learn how to make Minecraft 1.8.9 mods - but wow it's hard to find stuff now about this.
Anyways this uses a mixin to prevent the renderer from displaying your helmets from a third person view while letting other's pass.<br>
### Usage
To enable or disable the mod just run **/helmettoggle** in game.<br>
This does not toggle all helmets, only your own.
