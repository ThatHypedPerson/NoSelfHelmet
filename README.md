# NoSelfHelmet
A simple Minecraft 1.8.9 Forge mod that can disable the player's helmet from rendering.<br>
I created this just to learn how to make Minecraft 1.8.9 mods but wow it's hard to find stuff now about it.
Anyways this uses a mixin to prevent the renderer from displaying your helmets from a third person view while letting other's pass.
### Usage
To enable or disable the mod just run **/helmettoggle** in game.<br>
This does not toggle all helmets, only your own.
